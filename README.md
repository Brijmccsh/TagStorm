# TagStorm

TagStorm is a Chrome extension that automatically tags and organizes bookmarks based on the context in which they were saved. It helps users manage bookmark overload and easily find saved pages later. 

## Features

- **Automatic Tagging**: When a user bookmarks a page, TagStorm analyzes the page content, URL, and user's recent browsing history to generate relevant tags.

- **Time-Based Context**: Tags pages with time-related information like "Morning Read" or "Late Night Research" based on when they were bookmarked.

- **Project Association**: Users can define current projects or tasks, and TagStorm automatically associates bookmarks with these projects based on content relevance.

- **Mood-Based Categorization**: Uses browser history and page sentiment analysis to tag bookmarks with mood indicators like "Inspirational," "Technical," or "Leisure."

- **Smart Search**: Provides an enhanced bookmark search function that utilizes contextual tags to help users find saved pages more easily.

- **Tag Cloud Visualization**: Offers a visual representation of bookmark tags, helping users understand their browsing patterns and interests.

- **Adaptive Learning**: Improves tagging accuracy over time by learning from user interactions and tag modifications.
